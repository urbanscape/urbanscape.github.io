                <p style="text-align:left">The Columbia GSAPP Housing Lab is an interdisciplinary student-led space for action. The lab brings together faculty and students from across disciplines to leverage expertise around some of the most critical challenges facing urban housing today, and is a locus for testing and demonstrating methods of practice-based scholarship and pedagogy. Over the past year, the Housing Lab has produced a wide range of outputs -- below are some of the works that I have directly produced or been involved in with a larger team.<br><br>Link: <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/research/labs/15-housing-lab">https://www.arch.columbia.edu/research/labs/15-housing-lab</a></p>

        <p style="color:black; font-family:Roboto; font-size:110%;"><br>The Housing Lab began in late Fall 2019 by documenting existing New York City New Law Tenements built between 1901 to 1930. I was part of a team that conducted research on material sourcing, where I processed hydrology maps and diagrammed the timber production cycle as part of the greater regional ecologies diagram.<br><br> The lab then explored specific case studies like East River Homes (Cherokee Apartments) by Architect Henry Atterbury Smith in 1912 through extensive modeling. The drawing below was produced by the Housing Lab team and I was responsible for modeling building form and some detailed components of the building.</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-family:Roboto; font-size:110%;"><br>Finally, the team analyzed publicly available data to make maps and further analyze the conditions of these buildings today. The New York City "tenement" econmpasses multi-unit building three to seven stories, often built of brick or masonry, and typically marketed to working-class or immigrant New Yorkers. Early tenements, built in the mid-1800s, had severely restricted access to light and air and were frequently overcrowded. To address this, a coalition of reformers redefined the term under the 1901 New York State Tenement House Act, often referred to as the "New Law" tenements. The law mandated that all rooms have outward facing windows, proper ventilation, and fire safeguards. Today New Law Tenement buildings make up more than half of New York City's residential units and is a part of the distinct identity of the city.<br><br>I produced the map below of existing New Law Tenements through New York City Department of City Planning's MapPLUTO data.</p>

<!--        <p style="color:black; font-family:Roboto; font-size:110%;">Currently, areas with high concentrations of New Law tenements in the city are disproportionately home to low- and middle-income Black and Latinx households</p>-->
        
        <p style="color:black; font-family:Roboto; font-size:110%;"><br>Since then, new laws have been introduced by the city. Below is a snapshot of the pioneering regulations implemented in New York City's recent history, each of which earmark a progressive movement to improve the quality of housing and building. I produced the axonometric diagrams and the regulations were pulled from research done by the team.</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-family:Roboto; font-size:110%;">Currently, I am part of a team looking at opportunities for retrofitting existing New Law Tenement buildings based on the available floor-to-area ratio (FAR) as well as looking at Manhattanville case studies for potential collaborations for technical assistance. As part of the lab, I hope to bring my knowledge of clean-energy retrofits like solar panels, to further develop the research.</p>
